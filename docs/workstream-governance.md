# Software Supply Chain Workstreams

## Overview and Motivations

Project and user representatives who take part in the Software Supply Chain SIG are welcome to form a workstream to work on specific areas of interest in a more focused and structured way.

The expectations from workstreams would vary depending on the area of focus. Workstreams could focus on collecting the state of things in a specific area from within the ecosystem and contribute that to the domain, or come up with a proposal to address some of the needs in a more structured way in order to socialize their ideas further and increase the awareness.

Workstreams should, at a regular cadence, share their progress with the rest of the SIG. Workstreams could liase with the Software Supply Chain SIG to present ideas per area on CDF TOC level in order to gather feedback.

## Lifecycle

Working groups are temporary in nature. They are formed to focus on specific goals and can be disbanded after reaching their goals. Upon formation, leads for the working group are choosen by the working group. When leads step down, they can be replaced by [lazy concensus](https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/FAQ/ProjectLevel/CommunityQuestions/What_is_%22Lazy_Consensus%22%3F). However, working groups can also be disbanded if there is no longer a lead for the working group (within an 8 week grace period).

## Proposing a new Workstream

We welcome proposals for new workstreams. ðŸŽ‰

Proposals for new workstreams can be made via a [PR](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-software-supply-chain/pulls) on the Software Supply Chain SIG repo, for discussion and feedback.

Please create a directory in the [workstreams directory](../workstreams/) with a README providing information about the workstream's focus, goals, membership, and meeting logistics.

Add your proposal, and a link to your PR, to our [meeting notes](https://hackmd.io/MX4W9EE0RBeO3xfJ9wDi_Q) as an agenda item to discuss at the next SIG meeting. Discussion during the SIG is a great way to gather further feedback and support and attract additional collaborators.

## Current Workstreams

Current workstreams can be found in the [workstreams directory](../workstreams/).

## Archived Workstreams
