# Roadmap

## Mission: Define industry standards for Supply Chain Maturity.

The Working Group seeks to define standards for measuring supply chain maturity.

Supply chain maturity metrics will cover artifact creation and management,
testing, rollouts, deployments, rollbacks, and more. Defined maturity levels will
enable practitioners to identify growth areas and improve their supply chain management
using measurable best practices with defined goals and benefits.

### Related Work

[SLSA](http://slsa.dev) covers the supply chain from code through artifact enabling
better supply chain integrity and security by ensuring reliable provenance for built
artifacts. SLSA serves as an input to Supply Chain Maturity; the existence of similar
levels and definitions across the supply chain will shape our maturity ladder.
