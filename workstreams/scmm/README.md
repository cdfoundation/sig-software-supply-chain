# Supply Chain Maturity Model Workstream README

This is a workstream within the CDF SIG Software Supply Chain.

The forming of this workstream was suggested at a [recent SIG Software Supply
Chain
meeting](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-software-supply-chain/blob/main/docs/meetings.md#August-25-2022)

## Scope

The workstream will cover CICD beyond build and deploy.

## Mission

The workstream seeks to define industry standards for Supply Chain Maturity that
augment [SLSA](http://slsa.dev).  Where SLSA covers the supply chain from code
through artifact, maturity covers the artifact lifecycle, including deployments,
rollouts, testing, rollbacks, and more.

The workstream seeks to define an industry standard to augment [SLSA](http://slsa.dev).

Proposed names so far include:
*  Code Health Project Score ("CHiPS") (but it conflicts with [CHIPS
   Alliance](https://chipsalliance.org/) under the Linux Foundation)
*  Guide for Understanding Application Concerns ("GUAC")

Our first priority will be to identify additional clever retronyms and settle on
a memorable name.
